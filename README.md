# next carpool

### Notes
* Improvement is going to be enough. This flow is super busted.
* This app is fully tested.
* Offline first! (can also be *feature* moral of story is: this code is so concise && optimized that it is enough)

### Need to:
* Just add the styling.
* 

* Driver or Rider
  * One car can only have 1 driver spot.
  * Should possibly be made by drivers only?
* Skimming old project:
  * Need to just see scheme on how links are generated.
  * Further research firebase database posts & how everything is updated.
  * Find how googlemaps is coming into the mix.  **latitude & longitude is being saved in firebase**/
